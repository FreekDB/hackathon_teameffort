# FireFox extension for launching TOPspin

## What it does

This web extension invites TOPdesk employees to take a break, by opening the TOPspin page and inviting them to play.

(The content script also draws a red border around the document.body.)

## Credits

* This web extension is based on the borderify example from Mozilla (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension).
